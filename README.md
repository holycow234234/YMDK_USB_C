# YMDK/Aliexpress Aluminum CNC TKL Case USB C Daughter Board:
I wanted my new keyboard to use USB C, so I made this.
This daughterboard is intended for use with [this case](https://ymdkey.com/collections/case/products/cnc-anodized-aluminum-case-shell-for-filco-cm-cooler-master-87-tenkeyless-mechanical-keyboard-including-detachable-usb-module)

Credit to sparkfun for the schematic, I used their usb C breakout board as an example.

You can desolder the cable from the daughterboard that comes with the case and use it with this board.<br />
This works with the screws included with the case, just push hard!

# BOM:
* GCT USB4105 Usb type C port
* 2x 0805 5.1k ohm resistors

I had success with 1.6mm FR4
